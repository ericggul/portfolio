My old ideas, reflecting, sometimes feel stupid… But there is a clear connection between what I thought about a year ago and what I’m envisioning currently. 
So need more better form of recording my idea than just note taking? Note taking is a different medium than writing.
Writing also helps you to recap what you’re thinking right now.

Writing style: Don’t want to take too much time on the writing itself. Not about writing for the sake of writing, more of recording.
Thanks to ChatGPT!
Avant-garde style digital writing, sentence won’t usually make sense… I just skim-write it, very fast, with lots of grammatical errors. But those errors are actually good, the essence is only the idea.
After doing this very vague writing, convert into ChatGPT to add more ‘flesh’ on top of this ‘bone’, and fulfill contents in a universally readable format. Also translate in korean concurrently for other audiences.
