  text: `Sum and Part: How sum of part can be archived and displayed differently, presented audio-visually in an aggregated manner, and how this can influence viewers/participants of the act of part

  Precise examples: 
  
  Starbucks Siren Order, So many siren orders happening all around the globe 24/7, what if there’s one real-time visualisation (on the map or can be more abstractive) which displays the real-time siren order status and pop-ups data accordingly
  Same for Delivery services… A real-time audio-visualisation map showing real-time delivery service status
  
  These are the reflection of the society we’re living in, representing the so-called ‘convenience’ triggered by technologies & platform economies, also showing our daily consuming pattern, which might occur only once or twice from the individual’s perspective, but when viewed from collective, comes quite massive, even chaotic.. Creating a sort of ‘불멍' for the contemporary technology-driven consumeristic society. Almost reminiscent of Andreas Gursky’s Frankfurt Photographs – The amplified version of the part.
  
  The interesting part: Part is delivered by the individual’s optimal solution/choice of doing an action (i.e., I would like to deliver because of ____ ____), but the chaotic aggregation of a whole, gives you a pretty much different feeling… The feeling of how society is working… Almost same to watching endless cars crossing Hannam Bridge
  
  Or other examples, related to previous Scream Propagation/Stress Propagation ideation
  
  Scream Propagation: Act of sharing the stress with a global audience in the world. A person can scream on the mobile app, and that information is propagated to another user, most notably the screen which archives & displays the real-time screaming status → Kind of abstractive audio-visual triggered whenever somebody screams. The act of (anonymously) ‘shared screams’ 
  Stress Propagation: Similar, but this time targeting on stress: Large keyboard button-shaped sculpture/sponge, people can hit it whenever they are stressed out → Embedded Arduino sensor triggers websocket signal, and same here → Maybe the screen placed at the lobby, or installation at the museum, is triggered whenever somebody hits the stress button, and displays according audio-visual. 
  
  These two acts - Scream/Stress Propagation, aim to make our society more collective. Screaming Alone, expressing stress alone -  due to a highly individualistic society, it is now no longer considered ‘normal’ to express everyday stress/scream… Therefore we’re psychologically more separated than ever → Why is Korea ranking No.1 in suicide rate? 
  
  Maybe we wouldn’t want to share these screams/stress to our close surroundings, but maybe would want to express our situation somehow… anonymously… (Reasons why communities like Blind/Everytime is flourishing). What if we share this in the form of Multi-Device Web Artwork → We don’t know who is sharing our scream/stress, but we do know that it’s going to be shared to the public – To the public randomly walking through the building lobby, to the random audiences placed across the globe viewing exhibition? This is an act of how web & web technology can be used somehow poetically…. Lots of potential in it. Archiving Art, Real-Time Archiving Art
