  title: "De-semantising Semantics",
  text: `The picture showing Philippe Parreno's exhibition in leeum but the contents does not have direct association, just got it because i got inspiration while i was in the exhibition, listening to the delta-a talking random words

  We’re living in the age of semantics, everything is semantical,and AI is even creating more semantics - remember how many dummy-semantical texts LLMs are generating per day. This attempt: De-semantising semantics can act as doctrine for this semantic-prision
  
  Thee is a text…. Idk some kind of very serious, semantical text. Can be academical text. Can be philosophical reasoning… And on the main display it is read in a very serious/semantical manner
  
  But once the text is arrived at the word ‘껍데기' for example… let’s say the script was ‘빈 껍데기만 남을 뿐이었다'.... The word ‘껍데기's signifiant is transferred into different signifié → 돼지껍데기, for example. So the image of 돼지껍데기 appears in another screen. So on and so forth….
  
  For example let’s refer to this notoriously famous and semantical ‘Je pense, donc je suis’ by Descartes
  
  
  Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; And because some men err in reasoning, and fall into Paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of Geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for Demonstrations; And finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be something; And as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am,[c] was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the Sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search.
  
  
  Accordingly (Accordian), seeing (Eyes) that (Arrow) our (Symphony of anthem) senses (Five senses - need five monitors) sometimes (Sample from famous k-pop song) deceive us….
  
  Need a lots of multi channels
  Some extent it will be automised ai will look for other semantics -> De-semantising semantics
  Actually this is not the first attemp I think Hito steyerl did something with wikipedia-style hypertext (I don’t know what exactly was, chatgpt can you give reference when this was)
  So it’s actually combining lots of different audio-visual samples and people are not really awared of what the original text is almost 흡사 as 아무말대잔치 but it started actually from the very semantical text… Isn’t it the irony of the world but also how the brain works and how human is humane… hypertext thinking!
