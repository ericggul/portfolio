HELPING HUMANITY DIGEST THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY

Tech-Art: Technology-driven art practice, diverging from the traditional art world, focusing on a wider scope of audiences. Speculate the use of technology beyond practical/demonstrational domain, assisting audiences to experience/immerse into the use of latest/old technologies.

Art-Tech: Technology as topping, basically artwork. Normally fails to extensively use technology/dive deeper into technology. Ultimately the boundaries will be blurred!

Media Art Industry

Future of Media Art: Should be something like Film Industry?
- Camera Emerged → Movie as Genre Invented → Film grown up as separate Industry
- Computing (3D/AV/AI/XR) Emerged → New Media Art as Genre → Media Art growing up as independent industry

Current landscape: Polarised Media Art Industry
- Too Deep: Nonsense, Dependent on Gov & Art World
- Too Surface Level: Childish, Dependent on Instagram

Going beyond Art-Government Complex:
- Towards Independent/Self-Sustainable/Self-Funding Industry
- BUT not something just like Teamlab/Dstrict
- Should imply deeper narrative and research/reasoning than surface level A/V
- Not bounded by market principle: Not fulfilling existing/foreseeable demand, but rather creating a demand/language of expression

How to define Tech-Art?
Not a strict wording... yet

SPECULATION: Using Latest Technology & Speculating its usage to present Immersive & Interactive Artistic Experience
MEDIUM: Does not employ technology for implementation's sake, but contains critical employment of technology as artistic medium
NARRATIVE: Ultimately delivering the artist's message/philosophy, more than just presenting aesthetical audio-visual output

Why Web as Medium:
- Different Language, More Interactive, More Semantical, More Accessible, More Flexible
- JS is the world's most widely used computational ecosystem
- Leveraging Latest Technologies & Findings Directly, not through third-party
- Easily expandable & Closer to practical use-cases
- New way of expressing/New language of experiencing

Case of CES 2025:
- No deep reasoning/applicatory use-cases on technology, still focuses on low-dimensional presentation of products rather than integrated experience
- CLEAR sign of market & needs from business perspective
- If artists/designers can innovate & rebuild these exhibitions, they will surely discover a new market of tech-art
- Not only CES, but there is a clear need for next iteration of Apple Store for latest techs
- XD Lab can design/produce much better contents/artworks than what big enterprises at CES are doing

EXPERIENCE ECONOMY
Communicating experience, rather than individual product
Designing the Experience is crucial:
