  text: `Two simple experiment ideas using multi-modality

  Multi-Modal Inputs:
  
  Hand Tracking, Body Tracking, Eye Tracking
  Facial Expression
  Voice Input
  Mobile Scrolling, Mobile Pinching, Mobile Tapping, Mobile Conducting (Via Mobile Accelerometer)
  Keyboard, Mouse
  Etc….
  
  Multi-Modal 1. Expandable List UI via Eye Tracking
  
  Eye tracking on mobile environment → New approach?
  Expandable List UI: List with 10 (or more) items spanning y-axis, scrollable interface. Current interface design: limiting if people want to get detailed information on the item. Once people gaze at the item: that item expands, giving more detailed information about the item. Once people move to another item, the first item collapses, and the newly targeted item expands. Expandable List UI…. Can be used within UI design, but also artistically expanded into other domains. How about an expandable grid UI? How about different 15 screens changing/expanding according to the grid?
  
  Multi-Modal 2. Yawning/Screaming triggered via Mouse Opened Tracking
  
  Using Facial Expression → Easily track distance between two lips, can track mouse opened position… This mouse tracking can be used to create various interesting effects
  Das Gerede Part II (RGB) Idea: Three screens (each screen named R, G, B) having everyday ‘Das Gerede’ conversation… Very boring, very semantical, super make sense, hyper-real so that it’s boring. Here, once the mouse opened, yawning sound, the sound of boredom, unexpectedly added within the conversation… And the conversation goes on until the next mouse opens interaction → This time, screaming happens from the screen! And gradually, the ongoing conversation distorts… to more animal like screaming, yawning, non-semantical symphony from three distributed screens! This will be the basis idea of Das Gerede Part 2, criticising everyday normal boring conversations.
