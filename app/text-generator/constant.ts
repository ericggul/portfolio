  title: "Simple Interaction-based Immersiveness",
  text: `When talking about immersiveness. Usually within AR/VR context… Usually talks about very precisely constructed beautiful 3D scenes, as well as very high-fidelity interactions… Usually focuses on mimicking the real, making simulacres. 

  Yet, what I propose: Immersiveness is not merely about reconstructing the real, being immersed in the hyper-real, it is more of embodies and interconnectedness (to the dimension of reality), which might trigger from well-reconstructed scene, but also inducable from very simple interaction and the cognitive connection towards it - What I actually see from numerous VR games and artworks is when very complicated interaction paradoxically make users detached to the scene, and thus disentangling from immersiveness. What I propose is the opposite → Really starting from a simple interaction, very simple and somehow dadaistic (via repetition) that anybody can easily understand, and emphasising it, throughout targeted multi-channels, to create single interaction-based immersiveness. 
  
  Example: Mouse movement. Mouse movement is already used as a way of rotating the scene’s angle within Web Games/Wb 3D. What if… The mouse cursor itself is emphasised across the space? So single mouse movement from a single channel is propagated to multiple channels simultaneously, somehow exaggerated, somehow repeated, so people feel somehow will-to-power to their mouse movements, as well as dadaistic enjoyment → Their simple mouse movement has created a significant audio-visual change across 20 different channels! Wouldn’t that be amazing? Wouldn’t that be truely immersive?
  
  Example 2: Three.js OrbitControls → Rotation, Panning… How can this apply within multi channels?
