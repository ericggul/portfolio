  text: `Reflecting after reading wiki article on the pseudoscientific-ness of MBTI Tests
  MBTI test based on Barnum effect and confirmation bias
  I generally interpret this as individual’s fake desire to percept themselves as a special characteristic when that exact part is generalised → So people are actually flattened to one of the vectors while they are not aware of the fact
  
  So currently: MBTI Test → Classifying people within 16 types → People happy about it because of the Barnum Effect and Confirmation Bias and further define their personality/characteristic accordingly → They are actually being massively identical to each other 
  
  False-Classification and False-Individualism → Collective-Individualism, something that I defined earlier: People are externally more individualistic to each other, but actually characteristic-wise, essential-wise, they are becoming more identical to each other. Best example showing this: Test (수능), 의대진학, 반포자이즘, People compete each other to rank higher within a mono-defined dimension, but actually, due to this competition, they are increasingly becoming homogenous (Least marginal difference). Same for the personality test and MBTI types…. A collective suicidal attempt of uniqueness/unique humaneness
  
  What will happen in the age of Personally-Customised AI? (Like the movie ‘Her’...)
  
  Speculatively: Hyper-Customaised Conversation AI/Algorithm-generated customisation → Classifying people with existing vectorial classification (THE VECTORISATION OF HUMAN/HUMANENESS) → People happy about it, people thin k it’s hyper customsied, people think it’s real confronting own personality (Same because Barnum Effect and Confirmation Bias) → People become increasingly homogenous, people substituted/substitutable to exist as vectors, and thus, humaneness is now extinct → Human does not occupy any existential superiority against AI.
