James Turrell Room of Chinchu Art Museum, Naoshima → Projector
프로젝터 맺힌 상으로 관람객들 자연스럽게 Puppet Show
This puppet show symbolises a representatitve example of will-to-power
Small movement → Hand movement → Becomes amplified (As a shadow)
And thus audience enjoys the puppet show doing by themselves → They want their interaction to be amplified, and thus the amplified interaction to span the whole space, thus highlighting and enhancing their ability to control the space and influence the space (will-to-power)

Multi-Device Web Artwork, when symbolised conceptually, is a conversation between the actor/audience/subject and the space. Audience (Audience body’s expansion → Digital Devices) controls the surrounding space (Augmented Space/Augmented Architecture/Digitally Augmented Space). 

Thus comes the important of phenomenology → How to realise/meditate this conceptual connection of audience controlling the space with nowadays technologies and engineering/physical constraints? Traditional interactions like clicking might be not sufficient, maybe we need a somehow stronger interaction.

Also always important factor to consider: WILL-To-POWER. And thus how interaction is amplified, highlighted, and echoed throughout the space.
