Behavioural Interface: Rather than explicitly displaying icons/buttons to express the present of a certain function, those functions are implicitly hidden - and presented upon the user’s unconscious/unintended behaviour - creating a special context within the interaction design. (Especially important within the mobile interaction design)

So the key is in minimising and hiding functionality → and when the audience unintentionally/accidentally triggers such (normally phenomenological) interaction, then the hidden interface/functionality is presented.

For instance, Omega: People just do a normal Personality Test (Choosing from one of the options), but once they start to unintentionally shake/move the mobile device, the accelerometer triggers the ‘Omega’ signal - which triggers the destruction of the vectorised space within the artwork, which act as a symbolic act of phenomenological resistance within this artwork.

Another example: KAIST Museum AI artwork → Current plan, people first land on accelerometer-triggered interaction, where their phone shaking interaction rotates the surrounding accordingly at the start – Then once they accidentally speak out any word, the TTS + LLM combination is suddenly triggered, showing the Prop & Back-Prop interactions within multi-screens settings, and then displays the result accordingly (Symbolically showing how AI is embedded within our daily lives(?) + Wow-Effect: Verfremdungseffekt)

Thus Behaviour Interface is not designed for everyone to interact with - rather, it is target for relatively smaller group which will accidentally trigger such hidden interactions - but once they do trigger those, they will have an unforgettable/unique interactive experience where such uniqueness is triggered from the unexpectedness (Verfremdungseffekt) - as well as serving the literal ‘Distancing Effect’ of objectifying the situation/re-think about the interaction itself (Just like within the artwork Omega)
