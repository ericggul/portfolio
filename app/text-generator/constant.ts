Humans moving in space → and unprecedently, something happens on the surrounding screens/projections??

What if all the UIs/simple interactions we use in our daily web interfaces - are re-presented and re-interpreted within the space, with us human body used as the interactive pointer/mouse/finger → Finger within the smartphones, Body within the Installation (Bodily Experience)

Toggler: Boolean Interaction
Slider: 1-Dimensional Interaction
Pad/2D Mouse Move/Touch Move: 2-Dimensional Interaction

Toggler → Body being on the left of the space ←> Right of the space
Slider → Body moving across the single corridor/passage → And something occurring reactively on the screen
Pad Movement → Body moving within the 2D floor → And something occurring reactively on the screen

Thus, the human-as-interface tracks the body/human to create a bodily movement that influences the surroundings → And humans act as a big finger. A language that will expand the boundary of bodily interaction → Not through the wall projection, but through the floor-based bodily movement tracking.

Multi-Device Web Artwork: Inducing Physicality from Virtuality, is at the End - the communication between the subject and the space. The conversation between the subject and the space.
