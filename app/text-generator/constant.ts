  title: "A Psychology behind sneak-peeking other's AVOD in airplanes",
  text: `Famous meme → It’s funnier to sneak-peek other’s AVOD (movies, sports, etc.) rather than looking at my own. Even if the movie that other person is watching looks funny, if I look at it with my screen, not funny. The same kind of applies in undergrounds → For me it is funnier to sneak peek other’s smartphones than to look at mine. … Why?

  PHYSICALITY, a sense of spatial connection with the stranger. Obv the content on my screen is just about the content itself. Other’s contents in other’s screens → More spatial obstacles, more screens and AVODs, looking at movies which goes beyond my normal preference/choices, blended with a kind of tension that I might get caught sneak peeking, all happening with the physical space - Beyond just the digital audio-visual contents. All within the area of ‘uncertainty’ and ‘randomness’ that happens naturally within the domain of the physical world, not in an algorithmic pre-defined digital world. Ironically, the true value of digital content is realised within the physical world.
  
  What I’m trying to do with Multi-Device Web Artwork is bring this sense of physicality on top of the existing combination of digital content. To help people connect to the real world whilst leveraging the benefits of digital content. To prevent us from losing connection to the real world whilst being immersed so much in algorithm-generated trash, and help us to find again the very human, natural nature and desire to interact with the real physical world- Just as how we like to sneak peek other’s contents in planes.  
  
  An idea → How about a distributed audio-visual symphony made out of a plane’s 180 AVODs, changing & synchronising in real-time? Maybe DJ might be playing the music, and 180 AVODs alter their contents/visual accordingly. Maybe 180 people are playing one big simple game where they can all unite, or they can fight together in two big groups. Maybe more subtle poetic audio-visual → Very subtle enough to help people sleep during the plane. So many possibilities, both within interactive/non-interactive domains. So many new experience, a new experience that will unite passengers on board, yet to come. This will truly create unforgettable experiences…
  
  Same might be true for undergrounds, trains, buses, or any sort of public space where anonymity is currently ruling, but yet where people are open to communicate & connect with each other (who’s in the physical space) rather than just looking at phones, killing time. This will potentially bring us back the communal feeling, a sense of humaneness, and overall, our natural self-desire of connecting the domain of the real, rather than the fake.
