  Base Interest Rate from Federal Bank → During Covid it went down crazily low, for two years 2020 - 2022, and the world’s capitalistic structure rapidly reacted to this → Bitcoin Boom! Real Estate Boom! Every asset Boom! 
  
  Now the interest rate went up again after covid… Another series of Booms! Startup going down… Real estate smth… Isn’t it crazy that a single number 5.5% is changing the world’s dynamics?
  
  Ofc there a complicated dynamics related to this single number… It’s not just a number. Ofc I get it. BUT isn’t it still very silly, how the whole world is obsessed with this one-digit number percentage? Isn’t it silly how the whole world’s ecosystem is dependent on this number? Isn’t it silly how this number can control millions of people where they live - Many people who used to live in Seoul pre-covid, for example, were forced to move outside of the city as the rent price and real estate price went up crazily, a chain reaction of change due to the interest rate… Is this phenomenon logical? It is logical – Too logical to be true. Too much logic, to create illogic…
  
  Everyone is obsessed with Base Interest Rates.
  Everyone is obsessed with one person’s mouth.
  Everyone is dependent on this simple single number. 
  
  Or maybe… Everyone/Every system is too myopic to be dependent on this number which will eventually change after a period. The current system is fragile to a single number. And we’re so obsessed with it… Why are we so dependent on a single number? Isn’t this something we should tackle??
  
  A Multi-Device Web Artwork Installation Idea: One Input → Might be traditional GUI, might be hand-made tool, but has 3.XX % one digit + two decimal digits where people can adjust/customise, a symbol of interest rate (yet not explicitly told that it’s an interest rate). Audience can adjust this number → Increase or decrease.
  
  Surrounding screens: 10 + laptops or so, forming an ecosystem. Images might be abstract. Still need to ideate on what those images will be & what context they will be in, but it is a (not-to-direct) metaphor of the current economic society, economic environment (which is fragile/highly dependent to the input node - the interest rate)
  
  Normally these surrounding screens are relatively stable & calm. But once the number goes up & down dramatically, THE SURROUNDING SCREENS REACT VERY DRAMATICALLY & SENSITIVLY. Still need to ideate on what exact reactions this will be, might prefer a more dada-istic & humoristic approach, kind of explicit (too much explicit), but some cries & some laughs based on this unprecedented change in interest rate - symbolically presenting that the traditional capitalistic structure is no longer valid in a neo-liberal world, where individual’s idea and ability is too small on top of the simple change in the symbolic number…. But soon after 30 seconds or so after the change in interest rate, surrounding screens get calm again… Forming the new equilibrium state. Yes, this is the dystopia we’re living in, which is getting worse over time, but is justified as being ‘equilibrium’ in a long term.
