  text: `An idea of making an interactive Monochrome → Generated on top of bunch of texts, bunch of ChatGPT/LLM-generated texts

  Monochrome (단색화) Korean Most popular painting approach, a sense of materiality, diving deeper into it, the ultimate position of the abstraction, compared to the descriptiveness..
  
  On the other hand, there is descriptiveness: Language. Language is there to describe and is rarely used for abstraction. Of course, there is an abstractive layer - poems for example, but it’s far from the daily usage. especially the language represented by the ChatGPT nowadays - Most people might agree that ChatGPT is capable of writing descriptive/repetitive texts which already exists, but rarely can create a new poem or new layer of abstraction, other than mimicking the pre-existing styles of poems.
  
  My key theme: What happens if the data/AI-generated output/any descriptive/metaphysical output is converted if aggregated massively and repeated massively? I believe that ΣPart ≠ Whole. Part’s characteristic is transformed into a different dimension when aggregated as a whole. Its characteristics are converted, 일종의 왜곡을 겪는다… 성질적 변환이 이 속에서 일어난다. 
  
  This is the theme explored in my latest artwork ≠ → Where the sum of algorithm-generated results creates an abstractive layer, a layer of chaos. The part is interpretable and logical, ‘=’. The part is non-interpretable, illogical, chaotic, ‘ ≠’. It presents the aggregated chaos: Capturing the illogicality that is always presented with the seemingly logical systems, highlighting the limitation of the logic.
  
  The same might be possible within this monochrome approach? Maybe aesthetically referencing the old Laboratory Occupied project…. Aggregated Text might present a monochrome! Text is descriptive, meaningful… But the aggregated text is not meaningful at all, it’s diminished… Containing no meaning… It’s just a materiality, text is just consumed as material, ChatGPT is consumed as material, its meaning is diminished and disappeared… 
  
  Monochrome… Monochrome…. The infinite layers of meaning? No meaning? Meaning aggregated → No meaning?
  
  Now how to implement: Multi-Channel, single interactive input via keyboard. Upon keyword on six channels output chatgpt real-time generates some texts (should be generated accordingly to some meaning, idk what meaning/context will this be)... These texts, increasingly accelerates its accumulation speed as the interaction gets deeper… Now the screen is fulfilled with text (see the project untitled for example) and the layer of text…. Text is no longer visible

  Meaning→ Audience will first focus on meaning, 처음에는 의미에 집착한다, … 그러다가 나중에는 의미로부터 해방될 수 있지 않을까? 의미 그 자체보다는, 기의보다는 기표 (문자 그대로, 텍스트 그대로, 잉크 그대로러써의 기표) 를 긍정하고 그것으로부터 생성되는 하나의 거대한 체계에 Immerse 되는 형식으로
  
  Yes this might be my interpretation of immersiveness… Text-driven immersiveness, and interactivity (of starting from blank page → To accelerating to the whole monochrome) is quite important to me. This interactiivity, guiding audience from the meaning to the meaningless, from the language to the colour, from the descriptiveness to the abstraction… Is the key to the experience…
  
  Ultimately, therefore interaction → creates abstractive output, which constantly changes, yet not clear where it is ‘changed’.
