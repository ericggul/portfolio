Based on a special working experience at Adecco, the submission of An Echo was an attempt to tease Robert Walters. The artwork metaphors to the Adecco Group in various dimensions: The name of the artwork, An Echo, is pronounced like ‘Adecco’. The use of White Volkswagen Text on top of Gradient Red Background also metaphors to the Adecco’s Brand Logo. An introductory Mint Colour background metaphors the Adecco Group’s Brand Colour. Therefore, submission of An Echo itself can be considered as a performance art.

We’d like to keep the upcoming future under our control, so we attend conferences or subscribe to magazines which present a predictable future marketed under a name of ‘future insight’, when paradoxically, the anxiousness towards the future should have been triggered by its unpredictable nature.  Influenced by Marcel Duchamp(Tu m’), Henri Bergson(Inverted Cone), Friedrich Nietzsche(The camel and the baby), Lee Kun-Hee(Change everything except Spouse and Children), Jeff Bezos(Smile) and Elon Musk(Non-linear Tesla Stock), this interactive web artwork collages numerous signs and icons to contrast the characteristic of short-term future(situated in the left of the screen) from the long-term future(situated in the right), criticising the former and valuing the latter.   According to a Greek Mythology, a nymph called Echo could only repeat the last works spoken to her due to the curse of Hera. The artwork An Echo(Not to be confused with ‘Adecco’) criticises our tendency to act like an Echo when dealing with the future, not trying to affirm the randomness and thus overcome the uncertainty in a Nietzschestic manner, but instead, trying to predict the unpredictable by repeatedly projecting what happened in the near past into a near future.

Park, as Andy Warhol had quoted, is ‘a miniature countryside’, simulating what nature is in the middle of the crowded city. It is a paradoxical combination of artificial and natural, just as the AI models nowadays are: Can we distinguish such artificial-natural from real-natural? In other words, can we distinguish AI generated images from real images with our senses?  Quantitative research might say no to this question, that our senses are not capable of telling the difference between real images and generated images. This means that we are living in a completely simulative world, as Jean Baudrillard had said. A world where the real is being confused with a real image and a real image is being confused with a generated image. But does this mean that there is no way out of this maze of simulation?   Perhaps one of the solutions is to distort and transform whatever the object is, regardless of its genuineness: Rip off what it is into pieces, shake them violently, combine them awkwardly. Distort the object, disobey the rule, disregard the norms. This suggests a powerful way for the human being to stay creative in the middle of the simulation.  Influenced by Nam-June Paik’s Sistine Chapel, Sistine Park creates an impulsive and immersive experience from the non-immersive medium. Due to its interactive nature, Sistine Park is constructed in two parts: An individual screen where participants can access via smartphone, and the main screen displayed in the middle of the room. Given an AI generated park image, each participant is given a prompt to write down 10 ‘senses’ that it feels. Each time word is added, given image is slowly distorted, whilst the main screen recording each word is also tilted. In the course of image distortion, different images metaphoring Capitalism is added, such as a dollar, financial district and financial chart, insisting a connection between image distortion and monetary distribution in a semiotic context. Finally when any of the users reaches to write down 10 words, both of the individual and main screen is extremely distorted and animated, with the NYSE bell sound added as a background.

cl8yup4350082ftvp8xjtdvn1	Collective Opinion	Mobile HTML Screens	Oct 2022	4.543469387755102	98	cl89d01fw01075mvppoaa1hwj	This project criticises how public opinion is crystalised throughout modern web space, and how algorithms such as kNN(k-Nearest Neighbours) push us towards extremism. Contrasted to kNN, which groups people with similar interests (That is, people who had clicked similar news), this artwork symbolically promotes people with diverse interests to harmonise together.  17 news scraped from NYT is displayed on the initial screen. Each user will initially click on the news they are interested in, and the point that each user has clicked is recorded. Simultaneously, they will see that their screen is now full of colourful dots, where each dot represents the behaviour of other users clicking on the screen. Sound is generated accordingly, where two dots with far distance(i.e., diverse interest) will create sound with higher frequency/longer time.
